Note that a test rc file is included in this directory (.cs543rc).
Also note that a test log (mylog.txt) is also included, following the test case for functionality 4

Run commands:
	Test case 1: /bin/ls
	Test case 2: /bin/echo hello
	Test case 3: /bin/cat README.md
	Test case 4: sdfsdfsdfsdf
		#Error case

Run commands in background:
	Test case 1: /bin/ls &
	Test case 2: /bin/echo hello &
	Test case 3: /bin/cat README.md &
	Test case 4: sdfsdfsdfsdf &
		#Error case
Note that the prompt appears BEFORE the output usually, so the background portion is working
